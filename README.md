### Project Overview

The project aims to compile a high-level, OCaml-like syntax into a stack-based intermediate representation, which can then be interpreted. It includes a lexer, parser, desugarer, translator, and a stack-based interpreter.

---

### Directory Structure

* `ocaml_compiler/`: The root directory of the project.
    * `README.md`: A brief introduction to the compiler.
    * `base_interp.ml`: An OCaml script for interpreting stack programs from standard input.
    * `compile.ml`: An OCaml script for compiling high-level programs from standard input into stack programs.
    * `example-XX-compiled.my`, `fib-compiled.my`, `is-perfect-compiled.my`, `taxi-cab-compiled.my`: These are likely the compiled output of the `.myml` example files. The `[Non-text file]` indicates they are not meant to be directly readable as text.
    * `interp_03.ml`: This file contains the core logic for parsing high-level OCaml-like syntax, defining the intermediate stack-based language, and providing an interpreter for it. It also includes the desugaring and translation logic from the high-level to the stack-based language, as well as a serialization function for the stack programs.
    * `examples/`: This directory holds example programs written in the toy OCaml-like language (`.myml` files) and some pre-compiled stack programs (`.my` files).
        * `example-00.myml` to `example-04.myml`: Various small example programs demonstrating different language features like function definitions, arithmetic, and boolean operations.
        * `fib.myml`: An example implementing the Fibonacci sequence.
        * `is-perfect.myml`: An example to check for perfect numbers.
        * `simple.my`: A pre-compiled stack program demonstrating basic stack operations and function calls.
        * `sqdist.my`: A pre-compiled stack program to calculate squared distance.
        * `taxi-cab.myml`: An example related to the taxi-cab number problem.

### Core Files and Their Functionality

* **`README.md`**: A placeholder markdown file.

* **`base_interp.ml`**: This script reads a stack-based program from standard input, parses it using `interp_03.ml`'s `interp` function, and then prints the trace of the program's execution.

* **`compile.ml`**: This script reads a high-level program from standard input, compiles it using `interp_03.ml`'s `compile` function, and prints the resulting stack program.

* **`interp_03.ml`**: This is the most substantial file, containing:
    * **Utility functions**: Generic OCaml utilities for list manipulation, string conversion, and character checking.
    * **Parser combinators**: A set of functions to build parsers for context-free grammars (e.g., `satisfy`, `char`, `str`, `map`, `seq`, `many`, `alt`, `bind`).
    * **High-Level Syntax Parsing**: Defines the abstract syntax tree (AST) for the toy OCaml-like language (`uop`, `bop`, `expr`, `top_prog`) and implements parsers for expressions, function definitions, `let` bindings, `if-then-else` statements, and tracing.
    * **Stack-Based Language**: Defines the intermediate representation as a list of commands (`const`, `value`, `bindings`, `stack_prog`, `command`) and includes a parser for this stack language.
    * **Evaluation**: Implements an interpreter (`eval_step`, `eval_stack_prog`) for the stack-based language, which simulates a stack machine.
    * **Project 3 Specifics (Compiler Logic)**:
        * `expr_to_lexpr`: Converts a high-level expression into a simpler, "lowered" expression (`lexpr`) by handling multi-argument functions.
        * `desugar_fun_defs`: Desugars a list of top-level function definitions into a single `lexpr`.
        * `desugar`: The main desugaring function for the top-level program.
        * `translate`: This is the core compilation function that takes a `lexpr` (desugared high-level expression) and translates it into a `stack_prog` (a list of stack commands). This function handles various operators, control flow, function applications, and variable lookups/assignments.
        * `assign_name`: A helper function to transform OCaml identifiers into a format suitable for the stack-based language.
        * `serialize`: Converts a `stack_prog` into a human-readable string representation, including indentation.
        * `compile`: The top-level compilation function that orchestrates parsing, desugaring, translation, and serialization.

### How it Works (High-Level)

1.  **Parsing**: The `parse_top_prog` function in `interp_03.ml` takes the high-level OCaml-like code and converts it into an abstract syntax tree (`top_prog`).
2.  **Desugaring**: The `desugar` function (which calls `expr_to_lexpr` and `desugar_fun_defs`) transforms the initial AST into a simpler `lexpr` representation. This step typically flattens constructs like multi-argument functions into nested single-argument functions.
3.  **Translation**: The `translate` function converts the `lexpr` into a sequence of stack machine `command`s. This is where the core compilation happens, mapping high-level operations to low-level stack instructions.
4.  **Serialization (for output)**: The `serialize` function takes the generated `stack_prog` and pretty-prints it into a string format that can be saved or displayed.
5.  **Interpretation**: The `eval_stack_prog` function executes the generated stack commands, simulating a stack machine and producing a trace of print statements.
